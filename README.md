# QFT Markdown

A reusable browser workspace for Markdown and mathematics, released under the **MIT license**. Write in a source editor, read the result alongside it, and take your document with you as Markdown, HTML, or a printed PDF.

Built with Astro, CodeMirror, markdown-it, and KaTeX. The application runs in the browser and deploys as static files on **GitHub Pages**. Drafts stay in this browser's storage; there are no accounts or cloud documents. You can fork it, change the branding, and host it on your own domain or GitHub project URL.

## What you can do

- Write in a CodeMirror editor with line numbers, find and replace, and adjustable text size.
- Switch between split view, editor, and preview; resize the panes and toggle synchronized scrolling.
- Use inline and display mathematics with `$…$`, `$$…$$`, `\(…\)`, and `\[…\]`.
- Keep named drafts with automatic local saving. Concurrent edits in other tabs are preserved as conflict copies.
- Import a `.md` file as a separate draft and download Markdown without changing its source.
- Export a portable HTML document with embedded math fonts, or use **Print / Save PDF**.
- Start from worked mathematical and physics examples; use the outline to navigate longer notes.
- Read in light or dark mode. Math errors remain visible and link back to their source.
- Choose whether to load remote images. They are blocked by default.

## Start locally

Use **Node 24.22.1** and **npm 11.9.0**. The Node version is recorded in `.node-version`; package versions and the dependency graph are recorded in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local address printed by Astro. The editor is at `/`; supporting pages include `/guide/`, `/examples/`, and `/about/`.

## Check and build

```sh
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Astro writes the finished static website to `dist/`. Commit the source and lockfile; `dist/` and `node_modules/` are intentionally ignored. The [Check workflow](.github/workflows/check.yml) runs the checks without publishing.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Open the repository's **Settings → Pages** and choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
2. Configure a custom domain there if you want one. For the original deployment, use `md.qft.org` and follow the DNS instructions in the [deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
3. Push to `main`, or run **Deploy to GitHub Pages** from the Actions tab.

The [deployment workflow](.github/workflows/pages.yml) installs the pinned toolchain, checks the source, runs the tests, builds the site, and publishes `dist/`. It obtains the site's URL from GitHub Pages, so it also supports forks served at `https://your-name.github.io/your-repository/`. No personal access token or application secret is needed.

GitHub Pages does not provide configurable HTTP response headers. The HTML layout supplies a Content Security Policy and referrer policy; see [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the limits of those policies. See the [verification record](docs/VERIFICATION.md) for completed checks and remaining browser checks.

## Make it your own

Edit [`src/config/site.ts`](src/config/site.ts) for the site name, tagline, description, and source repository link. Replace `public/favicon.svg` and adjust the styles or examples as needed. Deployment URLs are separate from branding: the Pages workflow supplies `SITE_URL` automatically; another host can supply the same build-time setting.

The [reuse guide](docs/REUSE.md) covers forks, custom domains, subdirectory deployments, customization, and the license notices to preserve. The project does not require a QFT name, logo, or promotional backlink on your version.

## Mathematics

```markdown
The commutator is $[x,p]=i\hbar$.

\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\lvert\psi(t)\rangle
=\hat H\lvert\psi(t)\rangle.
\]
```

Use backticks or fenced code blocks when demonstrating syntax literally. A backslash-escaped dollar sign is ordinary text. KaTeX renders a supported subset of TeX mathematics, rather than compiling a complete LaTeX document. Document-local definitions can be written in the source; no separate macro settings panel is required. See the in-app guide for supported syntax and examples.

## Your documents

Local saving is convenient, but it is not a backup. Clearing site data, private-browsing policies, or changing browser/profile can remove or hide local drafts. A custom domain, a different Pages hostname, and localhost have separate browser storage; project paths on the same host use separate application storage names. **Download Markdown for anything you want to keep independently.**

The application does not send document text to a server. The host still receives ordinary website requests. If you enable remote images, your browser contacts the image hosts. Portable HTML export embeds the math fonts and downloads enabled remote images for embedding; that image download requires the host to allow cross-origin access. If an image cannot be embedded, export reports the problem rather than silently leaving a network-dependent image in the file. You can turn off remote images and export the document with image placeholders instead. There is no link sharing, collaboration, synchronization, or service worker in this release. An open editor continues working without server processing, but reopening the website offline is not guaranteed.
